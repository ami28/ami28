	<h1>An Interaction Designer, with Master degree in Design from 
	IIT Bombay.</h1>
	<p>
	I am currently designing products with a user-centric approach. I strive to create meaningful experiences with a touch of delight.
	</p>

	<p>
	Practicing design for over a decade and having worked on various design disciplines like branding, graphic design, publication design, type design and recently, end-to-end lifecycle of a product, I am constantly learning and evolving. I enjoy working with people from other disciplines and skill-set, and have a proactive approach towards solving design problems.

	<p>
		Interactive objects and spaces, motion graphics, and minimal visual/industrial designs interests me.
